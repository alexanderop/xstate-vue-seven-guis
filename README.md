# xstate-vue-seven-guis

## Overview
This project aims to provide a solid foundation for learning and understanding how to use Xstate in a Vue 3 application. It covers the basics of state machines and statecharts, as well as how to implement them using the Xstate library.

Getting started
Clone the repository and install the dependencies:
```bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/alexanderop/xstate-vue-seven-guis
cd xstate-vue-seven-guis
npm install
````

Start the development server:
```bash
npm run serve
```
This will start a development server and open the application in your default browser.

## Explore the code
The project is structured as follows:

src/components: contains the Vue components that make up the application.

src/machines: contains the state machines and statecharts used in the application.

The project includes examples of how to use Xstate in a Vue 3 application. You can start by exploring the code and trying to understand how the different pieces fit together.

## Model-based testing
The final goal of this project is to learn how to write model-based tests for the state machines and statecharts in the application. You can use the Xstate testing library to write tests that verify the behavior of the state machines and statecharts. The Seven Guis Challenge is a great way to get started with model-based testing and learn about the different ways to test state machines and statecharts.
